preprocess steps:
	#1. subtract gaussian smooth images

	#2. adaptive hostogram equalization

	#3. normalization each slice with zeros mean and unit std

train the network
	#cross validation method is used for invastigating effients of multi-modality.
	trian: random crop the train data to 80*80*80 because of limitation of GPU memory

	test: the probability map of whole volume was generated in overlap-tiling strategy for stitching the sub-volume results

evaluate parameters

	#dice coefficients
